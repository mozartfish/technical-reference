# Technical Reference

I created this website to keep track of all the blog posts, books, and free online materials that I reference frequently. This website originally started off as a google doc which became difficult to maintain so I decided to move it online inspired by the [UCB HCI Prelim](https://chanwutk.github.io/ucbhciprelim/) website.<br> 

If you have any suggestions about what I should add or reorganize please send reach out over email!
