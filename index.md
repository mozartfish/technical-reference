# Technical Reference

Hi, I'm Pranav! I am a second year machine learning masters student @ KTH. Broadly my interests are in machine learning, visualization, systems, and Human-AI Interaction especially the intersection of these areas. Previously, I studied computer science and human-centered data computing at the University of Utah and [Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute](https://sci.utah.edu/).

This website originally started off as a google doc which became difficult to maintain so I decided to move it online inspired by the [UCB HCI Prelim](https://chanwutk.github.io/ucbhciprelim/) website. Most of the resources and links relate to my interests in machine learning and its applications in visual computing, Human-AI Interaction, systems (specifically for AIML), math and nlp.<br> 

Special thanks to the following people: 

**Systems**: [Ryan Stutsman](https://rstutsman.github.io/), [Amir Payberah](https://payberah.github.io/), [Matthew Flatt](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/)
