# Technical Reference

Hi, I'm Pranav! I am a final year machine learning masters student @ the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) and a masters thesis candidate in the [Computational Aesthetics Group](https://www.kth.se/profile/hedvig/page/research-overview) currently working on my thesis  **Computer Labeling of Music Sound for Training Generative AI Models** under the supervison of [Hedvig Kjellström](https://www.kth.se/profile/hedvig?l=en) and [Bob Sturm](https://www.kth.se/profile/bobs). Broadly my interests are in machine learning, signal processing, systems and human-ai interaction especially the intersection of these areas. Currently I am exploring machine learning + signal processing and its applications in computer vision and audio. Other areas of interest include generative modeling, language engineering, visualization and data tooling. I studied computer science and human-centered data computing at the [University of Utah](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) and [Utah Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute](https://sci.utah.edu/).

This website originally started off as a google doc which became difficult to maintain so I decided to move it online inspired by the [UCB HCI Prelim](https://chanwutk.github.io/ucbhciprelim/) website. Most of the resources and links relate to my interests in machine learning and its applications in visual computing, Human-AI Interaction, systems (specifically for AIML) and math.<br>
