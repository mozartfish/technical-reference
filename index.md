# Technical Reference
Hi! My name is Pranav and I created this website to keep track of all the blog posts, books, and free online materials materials that I reference frequently. I studied computer science and human-centered data computing at the University of Utah before transitioning to machine learning. I have many interests in machine learning and data and currently I'm learning about diffusion, big data processing, and probabilistic machine learning.<br>

This website originally started off as a google doc which became difficult to maintain so I decided to move it online inspired by the [UCB HCI Prelim](https://chanwutk.github.io/ucbhciprelim/) website. Most of the resources and links relate to my interests in machine learning and its applications in visual computing, Human-AI Interaction, systems (specifically for AIML) and language technologies.<br>
