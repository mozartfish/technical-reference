## Background 
This page is a list of everything that I have found to learn machine learning in the llm chatgpt era. I used a lot of these references during my undergrad and I discovered new resources and courses that helped me study for some of the challenging courses during my masters program. [Kylie Ying](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkWv3oO4kHnu095L52vLCVK8YN33yRrd_&feature=shared), [Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com), [Josh Starmer](https://statquest.org) were a huge inspiration for this page because of how they organized the concepts on their websites and youtube channels. I recommend following the materials starting from the **Introduction** to **Machine Learning Fundamentals** in order to understand the material in the **Machine Learning Subfields** section.

## answerAI 
[answerAI](https://www.answer.ai/) was founded by Jeremy Howard and Eric Rees in 2023 as a new R&D lab focusing on fundamental research and the development of practical applications based on research breakthroughs. answerAI is the successor to [fastAI](https://www.fast.ai/) which was founded by Jeremy Howard and [Rachel Thomas](https://rachel.fast.ai/). fastAI left a legacy with its machine learning research and highly regarded state of the art machine learning courses that aimed to make deep learning accessible to everyone regardless of their math background which was revolutionary at the time the courses were released. Today fastai's materials are still used as an entry to the fields of deep learning and generative AI and at the University of San Francisco MS Data Science Program. Jeremy and his team still produce educational videos from time to time on [youtube](https://youtube.com/@howardjeremyp?feature=shared) and [continue to teach and innovate](https://www.answer.ai).
