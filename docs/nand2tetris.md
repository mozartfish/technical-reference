# nand2tetris
{: .no_toc }

[Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) is a pioneering online course taught by [Shimon Shocken](https://www.shimonschocken.com/) and [Noam Nisan](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~noam/) to build a computer from the ground up. Though the materials seem easy upon first glance, they are quite challenging even for the experienced programmer because they cover a wide breadth of information including boolean logic, computer architecture, assembly, compilers, operating systems and programming languages. People who have finished the course have gone on to complete projects including physically implementing the Hack Computer and building new games beyond Tetris. I wish I had reviewed this course before taking computer systems in my undergrad because I would have had a more systematic way of debugging low-level bugs.
