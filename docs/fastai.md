# fastai 
{: .no_toc }
[FastAI](https://www.fast.ai/) was an independent research lab started by Jeremy Howard and [Rachel Thomas](https://rachel.fast.ai/) that conducted fundamental machine learning research and taught one of the most highly regarded state of the art deep learning courses online free. The materials FastAI produced are still relevant today and do a great job of explaining the theory and engineering used in deep learning.

In 2023, Jeremy launched
[AnswerAI](https://www.answer.ai/) with Eric Rees as a new R&D lab focusing on fundamental research and the development of practical applications based on research breakthroughs. He still produces educational videos from time to time on [youtube](https://youtube.com/@howardjeremyp?feature=shared) which are definitely worth checking out.
