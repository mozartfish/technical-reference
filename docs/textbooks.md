#### Variational Inference 
Variational Inference is an approximation method in Probabilistic Machine Learning and was the focus of KTH DD2434. It's very confusing if you are unfamiliar with some of the traditional methods like MCMC, SMC and Bayesian Statistics(this was me when I took the class lol)
