# Things I am currently using (as of December 2024)

## Programming Languages 
* Python - main language for ml stuff these days
* Golang - occasionally for fun - want to get back to it at some point
* Java - slowly getting back into this - very important for data engineering (hadoop, spark, scala, big data processing). thought I'd never never have to write java again after CS 1410 and CS 2420 at Utah
* JavaScript - occasionally for fun and vis work. on my list to revist to understand how to actually use events for svelte applications
* SQL - haven't used in a long time 

## Data Libraries + Tools
These are libraries that I make sure to have installed for every project. I use conda for managing environments and package installation. Other alternatives include pip and [pyenv-virtualenv](https://jakobj.dev/posts/pyenv/#installation) 
* [numpy](https://numpy.org) - [installation](https://numpy.org/install/) 
* [scipy]() - [installation](https://scipy.org/install/)
* [sckit-learn](https://scipy.org/) - [installation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) 
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - [installation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html)
* [jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org/) - [installation](https://jupyter.org/install)

## Bayesian Modeling + Inference Tools
These are a specialized set of tools for probabilistic machine learning and probablistic programming with efficient and accurate implementations of MCMC and other probabilistic methods/algorithms. I have not used any of these but want to try them at some point with Ben Lambert's tutorials
* [pystan](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - [installation](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
* [pymc](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) - [installation](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/installation.html)

## Visualization Libraries + Tools
The python visualization ecosystem is fragmented and choosing the right visualization library depends on the project and audience . Many of the python visualization libraries build off of matplotlib. Matpotlib while tedious is super power powerful and versatile, with the ability to render interactive 3d plots, conic sections and do image processing work. Seaborn is great for statistical charts with an aesthetic similar to ggplot but the syntax can get gnarly. Altair is an easy to learn member of the Vega-Lite ecosystem but requires deep knowledge of the grammar of graphics and gets knarly with interaction and customizability.
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) - [installation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html)
* [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) - [installation](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#installation)
* [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) - [installation](https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/installation.html)
* [bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) - [installation](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps/installation.html)
